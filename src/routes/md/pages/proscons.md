### Pros and cons

**Path 1** (in-house) might make perfect sense if the set of items to search for is small and searching does not overload existing systems. There are no extra servers to manage, et.c.

**Path 2** (service) is possibly the easiest solution in terms of work hours since someone else takes care of the whole hosting situation. It can get quite costly though with a growing data set, higher loads and uptime requirements.

**Path 3** (on-prem) could be the only viable solution if you cannot use a service because of regulatory constraints. This might also be the only path if you need specific tweaks that are not included in any of the services.
